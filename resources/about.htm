        Hi, I am Batran. A data scientist by education and practice and is specialized in 
        applying machine learning to geospatial data.
      </p>
      <p>
          I hold a M.Sc. in engineering from the University of Tokyo. 
          My work there was mainly extracting mobility patterns from mobile phone big data.
           You can read all my publications <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohamed_Batran/publications">here</a> 

      </p>

      <p>
          Professionally speaking, I deployed multiple predictive machine learning models to production. One of them to predict package arrival time based on real-time position of driver and traffic data. I also worked with MNO telecom datasets to extract data points about each subscriber from his call details records e.g. home location, work location, cities he visits, working full time or not. 
      </p>

      <p>
          I work with a diverse tech stack. I use python, Java and Java script along with a strong knowledge of sql 
          and nosql databases. And experienced working with bigdata in spark and hive. I do luv visualization and storytelling,
           I use qgis, ArcGIS, uber libraries such as Kepler and mapbox gl. In addition, I have experience creating BI dashboards using tableau and other products.

      </p>

      <p>
          In my professional experience, I interacted with multiple business units to define the requirements of tech projects 
          and agree on acceptance criteria, timeline and roadmap. More importantly to translate business requirements to tech tasks and set well defined KPIâ€™s.

      </p>
